**Postmortem: The Great API Gateway Glitch of 2024**

*Ever felt like your computer was having a bad day? Well, our API Gateway did just that on August 22, 2024. Here’s how a load balancer mishap led to a day full of performance woes.*

---

### **Issue Summary**

- **Duration:** August 22, 2024, 14:00 UTC - August 22, 2024, 17:45 UTC
- **Impact:** API Gateway was like a slow-moving traffic jam. User requests were sluggish, with response times three times slower than usual. About 30% of users were stuck in this digital crawl.
- **Root Cause:** A load balancer that decided to take a nap at the wrong time.

### **Timeline**

- **14:00 UTC:** Automated alert yelled, “Houston, we have a problem!” Increased response times and errors were spotted.
- **14:05 UTC:** On-call engineer awoke from their coffee-fueled trance to investigate.
- **14:15 UTC:** Initial theory: Database was playing hide-and-seek. Investigations focused there.
- **14:30 UTC:** Database was found to be well-behaved. Shifted focus to the API Gateway and load balancer.
- **14:45 UTC:** Discovery: Load balancer was having a mid-life crisis. Traffic patterns were all over the place.
- **15:00 UTC:** Attempted to boost load balancer’s capacity. The issue persisted.
- **15:30 UTC:** Network and Infrastructure team was roped in for a deeper dive.
- **16:00 UTC:** Confirmed: Load balancer misconfiguration was the villain. Routing rules were all mixed up.
- **16:30 UTC:** Load balancer got its act together. Traffic distribution normalized.
- **17:00 UTC:** System checked and stable. Hooray! 
- **17:45 UTC:** Case closed, and a retrospective started.

### **Root Cause and Resolution**

- **Cause:** The load balancer was experiencing an identity crisis with incorrect routing rules. It couldn’t decide which server should handle what traffic, causing chaos.
- **Fix:** Recalibrated the load balancer's routing rules. After a few tweaks, it started playing nice again. The backend servers were relieved to finally get some balanced attention.

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures**

- **Improvements Needed:**
  - **Configuration Checks:** Like a pre-flight checklist for a plane—except for our load balancers.
  - **Monitoring Enhancements:** More granular monitoring to catch those sneaky load balancer issues before they hit critical mass.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Update Documentation:** Add load balancer configuration guidelines that even a toddler could understand.
  - **Automate Configuration Validation:** Implement automated tools to review configurations. If a load balancer goes rogue, we’ll know before it does.
  - **Enhance Monitoring:** Create specific alerts for load balancer performance. No more surprises.
  - **Conduct Training:** Provide engineers with top-notch training on configuring and troubleshooting load balancers. Think of it as load balancer boot camp.
  - **Review Incident Response:** Refine the playbook for quicker diagnosis and resolution. Because nobody likes being stuck in a slow lane.

In the end, this hiccup was a reminder that even digital systems can have off days. But with these corrective measures, we’re geared up to keep the traffic flowing smoothly in the future. Thanks for sticking with us through the slow lane!
